Welcome!

This app brings the classic and timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe to your fingertips. Upon opening the .xcworkspace version of the app and running on the iPhone simulator, you will be shown a randomly colored playing field where you and your opponents will battle for wits. If you feel the colors do not suit your preference, simple press the "Reset" Button and a new field will be generated.

Players have the option to choose the names of the two opponents playing (however the Computer will remain static for simplicity's sake). You can also choose your emojis, which will represent territories gained.

At the start of each match, you can select to play against a real-life opponent or a computer player. Once the game begins, players volly back and forth, attacking and counter attacking until either there is a decisive victor, or the match ends in a tie.

Wins are calculated and kept track of on the upper right-hand labels, and are exist only so long as the app isn't quit. This is to ensure friendships are maintained and no hostilities carry over through the lifetime of the app.


If time persisted and serious interest were to grow, added features considering merit would include the use of a local Database using Realm, an online web server using Vapor, enhanced computer AI, and the ability for players to interact across multiple devices. UI touch-ups and animations would also be considered, however serious contenders will agree these only distract from the heart of the game.

For now, I hope you enjoy honing your skills and challenging opponents through this clean and concise app, brought to you by Rob Deans and the TTP.
